I would like to implement handling redirections in my programs. Such as:
- < should redirect input.
- > should redirect output.
- << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesnâ€™t have to update the history!
- >> should redirect output in append mode.

How could I implement all of this into my program. Especially with the pipes. I imagine I would have to change something with STDIN_FILENO and STDOUT_FILENO.
